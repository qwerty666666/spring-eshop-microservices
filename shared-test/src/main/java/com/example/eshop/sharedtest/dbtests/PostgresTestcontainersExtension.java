/**
 * JUnit Extension which starts PostgreSQL Testcontainer.

 * Container is automatically started when Extension is loaded for the first
 * time and reused across all tests.
 * After start, it fills <code>spring.datasource.*</code> properties, therefore
 * after container startup Spring Context can be initialized with
 * container database.
 * <p>
 * This container can't be stopped manually. It will be stopped automatically
 * on JVM shutdown.
 * <p>
 * This class designed as singleton and is not thread-safe. Anyway we can't run
 * tests in parallel with testcontainers (From docs: <code>Note: This extension
 * has only been tested with sequential test execution. Using it with parallel
 * test execution is unsupported and may have unintended side effects.</code>)

    /*
     * We make it static to start container before any extension callback and therefore
     * datasource params will be initialized before Spring Context will be bootstrapped.
     *
     * It seems like JUnit is not guarantee that Extension will be initialized before
     * it is accessed for the first time. But in current implementation Extensions are
     * initialized when they are registered for a test class.
     * So, static initialization is a bit hacky, but it save us from keeping order of
     * Extensions registration (In JUnit Extensions registered in order they are declared on
     * class and Extensions from superclass are registered first), otherwise we must place
     * this Extension before SpringExtension.
     *
     * Another way to do this is register container bootstrapping by Spring's
     * @TestExecutionListeners. @TestExecutionListeners allows us to control order of
     * listeners execution. But @TestExecutionListeners can be used on class only once,
     * and it will conflict with @DbRider.
